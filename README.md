## **Limitations**

### Google Gemini API (Free Tier)

The free tier of the Google Gemini API has the following usage limits:

- **15 RPM** (Requests Per Minute)  
- **1 million TPM** (Tokens Per Minute)  
- **1500 RPD** (Requests Per Day)  

Exceeding these limits may lead to temporary restrictions or delays in request processing.

---

## **Key Features**

- **Topic-based Questions**: Generates random questions based on a specified programming topic.  
- **Multiple Answer Options**: Each question includes multiple answer options, with only one correct answer and an explanation for it.  
- **Code Examples**: Some questions include code examples for enhanced clarity and engagement.  
- **Batch Question Generation**: Supports generating up to **10 questions** in a single request.

## **API Endpoint**

### **GET `/api/v1/question/ai`**

**Query Parameters**

- `topic` *(string, optional)*:  
  The programming topic for the questions (e.g., `"JavaScript"`). Defaults to `"Frontend and Backend programming"` if not provided.  

- `amount` *(integer, optional)*:  
  The number of questions to generate (between 1 and 10). Defaults to **1** if not specified. If the value inputed is greater than 10, the API will return only **10 questions**.

## **Functions**

### `createPrompt(topic)`
This function generates a detailed prompt for the AI model to generate a question. The prompt includes very detailed and specific instructions for the format and structure of the question.

**Prompt Example:**

```
You are an expert programming instructor specialized in fullstack development. Generate a random multiple choice question in English suitable for junior fullstack developers. Focus on practical, real-world scenarios covering: ${topic}.
Add a code examples ONLY if the question would be clearer or more engaging(for example, to illustrate code behavior or provide more context), include a short, relevant code example.

Return ONLY valid JSON like this example:
{
    "question": "Question text here",
    "codeExamples": "Add a code snippet if needed, if not leave it empty",
    "answerOptions": [
        {"answer": "Option 1", "isCorrect": boolean},
        {"answer": "Option 2", "isCorrect": boolean},
        {"answer": "Option 3", "isCorrect": boolean},
	      {"answer": "Option 4", "isCorrect": boolean}
    ],
    "explanation": "Explanation here"
}
Ensure that there are no additional characters outside the JSON structure. Only return the JSON output.
```

### `getQuestionsFromAI(topic)`

- This function generates a single question based on the given or default topic. It interacts with the Gemini API to generate the question and extracts the JSON-formatted result.

### `generateQuestions(topic, amount)`

- This function generates a specified number of questions for a given or default `topic`. It uses the `getQuestionsFromAI()` function to create the questions and then stores them in the database.

**Parameters**

- `topic`
- `amount`

**Validation**

- Ensures `topic` is between 2 and 140 characters.
- Ensures and limits `amount` to between 1 and 10 questions.
